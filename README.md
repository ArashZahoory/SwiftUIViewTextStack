You know I love Swift!

But you also know, Apple has undergone some big changes recently with SwiftUI.

So, I’ve been tweaking, tinkering, testing and creating new example projects for you to have a great and easy experience of SwiftUI.

In today’s SwiftUI tutorial I will show you how to create text with SwiftUI. You will also learn how to create stacks with swiftui. 

You will be flooded with swiftUI tutorial tips and tricks like: 
text alignment, 
modified text, 
custom font size,
 format text, 
text color, 
textfield style, 
text edit,
